	[REMOVED FEATURES]

        - Remove options 'include_backup' and 'include_wrapper'. The first one
          does not really belong in the function and the second one is feature
          creep and a misconcept. To accomplish wanted feature,
          App::BashCompletionF will be modified instead.


0.03    2014-11-01 (PERLANCAR)

	- Return extra data when detecting wrapper script.


0.02     2014-11-01 (PERLANCAR)

         [INCOMPATIBLE CHANGES]

         - Rename option 'filter_x' to 'include_noexec' to be more consistent
           with the other 'include_*' options.

         [ENHANCEMENTS]

         - Add options: 'include_backup', 'include_wrapper'.
